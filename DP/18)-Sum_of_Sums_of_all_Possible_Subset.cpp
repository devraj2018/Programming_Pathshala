/*
Naive Approach: A naive approach is to find all the subsets using power set and then summate
                all the possible subsets to get the answer. 
                Time Complexity: O(2N)
Efficient Approach: An efficient approach is to solve the problem using observation. 
                    If we write all the subsequences, a common point of observation is that
                    each number appears 2(N â€“ 1) times in a subset and hence will lead to the 2(N-1) 
                    as the contribution to the sum. Iterate through the array and add (arr[i] * 2N-1) to the answer.
